# Unsupervised single-image 3D reconstruction using GAN's imagination ability


Finally, the project has been finished. I am cleaning the unnessesary code now. Update the code before next Monday. Before Monday, you can visit my google drive to observe some results. But i am sure that you do not want to see the code, it is messy with a lot of versions.AHHHH!
